Hi Jules,

We are about to start the development of an OctoPrint plugin . The main goal is to integrate my Geeetech A10 3D printer (running Marlin 2.1 firmware, currently managed by OctoPrint on a Raspberry Pi) with Prusa Connect. To do this, we will use the official `prusa-connect-sdk-printer` Software Development Kit (SDK) provided by Prusa.

**Project Setup and Resources:**

- **Starting Repository:** You will be working on my GitHub repository https://github.com/VisualBoy/PrusaConnect-Bridge,
 I will provide you with access to this repository and the specific branch where you should commit your work.
- **Reference Materials:** You will have access to:
    1. A detailed research report I received, which outlines the strategy, architecture, and technical details for this plugin https://github.com/VisualBoy/PrusaConnect-Bridge/raw/refs/heads/main/.doc/Prusa_Connect_bridge_for_Octoprint_overview.md
    2. The official documentation for OctoPrint plugin development https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/plugins/gettingstarted.html 
    3. The official documentation for the Prusa Connect SDK (`prusa-connect-sdk-printer`). Please refer to these documents for a thorough understanding of the context and technical specifications https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Connect-SDK-Printer

**Expected Output:** The primary output of your work will be functional Python code, committed iteratively to the designated branch of the GitHub repository. Each commit should represent a functional step forward, allowing me to test the plugin as development progresses.

**Detailed Development Tasks:**

I request you to implement the following functionalities in the OctoPrint plugin, committing progress regularly:

**1\. Initial Plugin Setup and Prusa Connect SDK Integration into the Repository:** \* Modify the plugin's `setup.py` file to include `prusa-connect-sdk-printer` as a dependency. \* In the `__init__.py` file (or a dedicated helper class), import and initialize the `Printer` object from the Prusa Connect SDK. Use OctoPrint's `StartupPlugin` mixin, specifically the `on_after_startup` method, for SDK initialization and starting the communication loop in a separate thread.  

**2\. Implementation of Printer Registration with Prusa Connect:** \* **Printer Identifier Management:** \* Implement logic to generate or retrieve a unique Serial Number (`SN`) for the Geeetech A10. Consider the UUID returned by Marlin's `M115` command , the Raspberry Pi's MAC address, or a randomly generated UUID. Store this `SN` persistently using OctoPrint's `SettingsPlugin`. \* Calculate the `FINGERPRINT` as a SHA256 hex digest of the `SN`. \* Use `const.PrinterType.I3MK3` as the `PRINTER_TYPE`. \* **Registration Flow:** \* If a saved token is not present, implement the `printer.register()` flow to obtain a `tmp_code` from the SDK. \* Display the `tmp_code` to the user via OctoPrint's notification system or plugin logs, with instructions to enter it on the Prusa Connect web portal. \* Implement the retrieval of the persistent `TOKEN` via `printer.get_token(tmp_code)` and store it securely using OctoPrint's `SettingsPlugin`. \* **Subsequent Starts:** Ensure the plugin uses the stored `TOKEN` to establish the connection on startup if it's already present.  

**3\. Implementation of Continuous Telemetry Transmission:** \* Create and manage a background thread that sends telemetry data to Prusa Connect via `printer.telemetry()` at least once per second. \* Implement the mapping of OctoPrint's printer states (obtained via `self._printer.get_current_data()`, e.g., "Printing", "Paused", "Operational", "Error") to the Prusa Connect SDK's `prusa.connect.printer.const.State` constants (e.g., `PRINTING`, `PAUSED`, `READY`, `ERROR`). \* Include current temperatures (from `self._printer.get_current_temperatures()`) and print progress (from `self._printer.get_current_data()`) in the telemetry.  

**4\. Implementation of Command Handling from Prusa Connect:** \* Use the SDK's `@printer.handler(const.Command.COMMAND_NAME)` decorators to implement handlers for commands sent from Prusa Connect. The priority commands are: \* `START_PRINT`: The handler must retrieve the filename from the command argument, find the file path in OctoPrint's file system (using `self._file_manager.path_on_disk("local", filename)`), and then start the print via OctoPrint (`self._printer.select_file(path_to_file, printAfterSelect=True)`). \* `STOP_PRINT`: Translate to `self._printer.cancel_print()`. \* `PAUSE_PRINT`: Translate to `self._printer.pause_print()`. \* `RESUME_PRINT`: Translate to `self._printer.resume_print()`. \* Ensure each command handler runs in a separate thread to avoid blocking the SDK's main communication loop and returns the required dictionary (at least with the `source` key).  

**5\. Implementation of File System Management for Prusa Connect:** \* Implement the logic to respond to requests for file information from Prusa Connect (typically via a `SEND_INFO` command or a similar mechanism triggered by telemetry). \* Use OctoPrint's `self._file_manager.list_files(recursive=True)` to get the list of files and folders. \* Format this information into the dictionary expected by the SDK for each file/folder, including `type`, `name`, `ro` (read-only), `m_timestamp` (last modified date), `size`, and for folders, `children`.  

**6\. Adoption of OctoPrint Plugin Best Practices:** \* Utilize OctoPrint's event bus (e.g., `Events.TEMPERATURE_RECEIVED`, `Events.PRINT_STARTED`, `Events.FILE_ADDED`) for reactive updates and to minimize direct polling of the printer where possible. \* Use OctoPrint's `SettingsPlugin` for managing all configurable and persistent settings (token, generated SN, Prusa Connect server URL, etc.). \* Implement clear and useful logging using OctoPrint's `self._logger` system to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

**Iterative Development and Testing:** I request you to implement these features incrementally. Commit your progress frequently to the designated branch. This will allow me to clone the branch, install the plugin, and test the functionalities as they are developed.

The ultimate goal is to have a robust and functional OctoPrint plugin that successfully integrates the Geeetech A10 into the Prusa Connect ecosystem.

I look forward to seeing your commits. Thanks!

### Prompt v2:

Objective: Please develop the OctoPrint plugin located at [https://github.com/VisualBoy/PrusaConnect-Bridge](https://github.com/VisualBoy/PrusaConnect-Bridge). This plugin is being developed from a fork of the OctoPrint "Hello World" plugin example. The primary goal is to integrate a Geeetech A10 3D printer (running Marlin 2.1 firmware and managed by OctoPrint on a Raspberry Pi) with the Prusa Connect cloud service. This integration will be achieved by utilizing the official `prusa-connect-sdk-printer` Software Development Kit (SDK) provided by Prusa.

Project Setup and Resources:
- Starting Repository: You will be working on the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/VisualBoy/PrusaConnect-Bridge](https://github.com/VisualBoy/OctroPrint-PrusaConnect-Bridge). Please commit your work to a new branch, for example, `feature/prusa-connect-integration` (or a specific branch I will designate).
- Reference Materials:
    1. A detailed research report outlining the strategy, architecture, and technical details for this plugin: [https://github.com/VisualBoy/PrusaConnect-Bridge/raw/refs/heads/main/.doc/Prusa_Connect_bridge_for_Octoprint_overview.md](https://github.com/VisualBoy/PrusaConnect-Bridge/raw/refs/heads/main/.doc/Prusa_Connect_bridge_for_Octoprint_overview.md)
    2. The official documentation for OctoPrint plugin development: [https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/plugins/gettingstarted.html](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/plugins/gettingstarted.html)
    3. The official documentation for the Prusa Connect SDK (`prusa-connect-sdk-printer`): [https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Connect-SDK-Printer](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Connect-SDK-Printer)
    Please refer to these documents for a thorough understanding of the context and technical specifications.

Core Functional Requirements:

1.  **SDK Integration and Plugin Initialization:**
    *   **Dependency Management:** Modify the plugin's `setup.py` file to include `prusa-connect-sdk-printer` as a runtime dependency.
    *   **SDK Object Initialization:** In the plugin's main Python file (e.g., `__init__.py` or a dedicated helper class), import the `Printer` class and `const` module from `prusa.connect.printer`.
    *   **Lifecycle Management:** Utilize OctoPrint's `StartupPlugin` mixin. In the `on_after_startup()` method, initialize the Prusa Connect `Printer` object and start its communication loop (`printer.loop()`) in a separate background thread to avoid blocking OctoPrint's main operations.

2.  **Printer Registration with Prusa Connect:**
    *   **Identifier Management:**
        *   Implement logic to generate or retrieve a unique Serial Number (`SN`) for the Geeetech A10. Options include:
            *   Querying the printer for its UUID via Marlin's `M115` command (OctoPrint might already have this).
            *   Using the Raspberry Pi's MAC address.
            *   Generating a random UUID.
        *   Store the chosen `SN` persistently using OctoPrint's `SettingsPlugin`.
        *   Calculate the `FINGERPRINT` as a SHA256 hexadecimal digest of the `SN` string (UTF-8 encoded).
        *   Use `const.PrinterType.I3MK3` as the `PRINTER_TYPE` when initializing the `Printer` object.
    *   **Registration Flow Logic:**
        *   On plugin start, check if a Prusa Connect `TOKEN` is already stored via `SettingsPlugin`.
        *   If no `TOKEN` exists:
            *   Call the `printer.register()` method to obtain a temporary code (`tmp_code`) from the SDK.
            *   Display this `tmp_code` to the user through OctoPrint's notification system and/or plugin logs, instructing them to enter it on the Prusa Connect web portal.
            *   Periodically (e.g., in a loop with a short delay) call `printer.get_token(tmp_code)` until the persistent `TOKEN` is retrieved.
            *   Once obtained, securely store the `TOKEN` using OctoPrint's `SettingsPlugin`.
        *   If a `TOKEN` exists, use it to configure the SDK connection via `printer.set_connection(SERVER, TOKEN)`, where `SERVER` is typically `https://connect.prusa3d.com`.

3.  **Telemetry Transmission:**
    *   **Continuous Reporting:** In a separate background thread, send telemetry data to Prusa Connect at least once per second using `printer.telemetry(...)`.
    *   **State Mapping:**
        *   Obtain the current printer state from OctoPrint (e.g., using `self._printer.get_current_data()` to check flags like `is_printing()`, `is_paused()`, `is_operational()`, `is_error()`, etc.).
        *   Map these OctoPrint states to the corresponding `prusa.connect.printer.const.State` enum values (e.g., `PRINTING`, `PAUSED`, `READY`, `ERROR`, `ATTENTION`).
    *   **Data Points:** Include essential data in the telemetry call:
        *   Current nozzle and bed temperatures (actual and target, from `self._printer.get_current_temperatures()`).
        *   Print progress percentage (if printing, from `self._printer.get_current_data()["progress"]["completion"]`).
        *   (Optional but recommended) Estimated print time remaining.
        *   (Optional) Name of the file being printed.

4.  **Command Handling from Prusa Connect:**
    *   **SDK Handlers:** Utilize the `@printer.handler(const.Command.COMMAND_NAME)` decorator to define Python functions that will handle commands sent from Prusa Connect.
    *   **Threading for Handlers:** Ensure each command handler logic (especially if it involves communication with the printer or long operations) is executed in a way that does not block the SDK's communication loop or OctoPrint's main thread (e.g., by dispatching to another thread or using OctoPrint's background task capabilities). The SDK documentation states the handler itself is called in a different thread from the `printer.loop()`.
    *   **Handler Return Value:** Each handler must return a dictionary, at minimum `{"source": const.Source.WUI}` (or other appropriate `const.Source`).
    *   **Key Commands to Implement:**
        *   `START_PRINT`:
            *   The handler will receive arguments, typically the filename (e.g., `args`).
            *   Use OctoPrint's `self._file_manager.path_on_disk("local", filename)` to get the full path to the G-code file.
            *   Instruct OctoPrint to select and start printing the file: `self._printer.select_file(path_to_file, printAfterSelect=True)`.
            *   Update printer state to `const.State.PRINTING` via `printer.set_state()`.
        *   `STOP_PRINT`:
            *   Instruct OctoPrint to cancel the print: `self._printer.cancel_print()`.
            *   Update printer state to `const.State.READY` or `const.State.ATTENTION` via `printer.set_state()`.
        *   `PAUSE_PRINT`:
            *   Instruct OctoPrint to pause the print: `self._printer.pause_print()`.
            *   Update printer state to `const.State.PAUSED` via `printer.set_state()`.
        *   `RESUME_PRINT`:
            *   Instruct OctoPrint to resume the print: `self._printer.resume_print()`.
            *   Update printer state to `const.State.PRINTING` via `printer.set_state()`.

5.  **File System Management:**
    *   **Reporting Files:** Implement logic to respond to Prusa Connect's request for file system information (likely triggered by a `SEND_INFO` command or similar mechanism).
    *   **OctoPrint File Access:** Use OctoPrint's `self._file_manager.list_files(recursive=True)` to retrieve the list of available G-code files and folders stored locally by OctoPrint.
    *   **SDK Data Structure:** Format the retrieved file and folder information into the dictionary structure expected by the Prusa Connect SDK. This typically includes:
        *   `type`: "FILE" or "FOLDER".
        *   `name`: Filename or folder name.
        *   `ro`: Read-only status (boolean, likely `False` for OctoPrint-managed files).
        *   `m_timestamp`: Last modification timestamp (Unix timestamp).
        *   `size`: File size in bytes.
        *   `children`: For folders, a nested dictionary of its contents.
        *   Information about `free_space` and `total_space` for the storage.

6.  **User Interface (Plugin Settings Page):**
    *   Utilize OctoPrint's `SettingsPlugin` and `TemplatePlugin` mixins.
    *   Provide a settings page for users to:
        *   View the current Prusa Connect registration status (e.g., "Not Registered," "Registered - Token: XXXXX...", "Awaiting code entry: YYY-YYY").
        *   See the Serial Number (`SN`) being used for registration.
        *   (Optional) A button to clear stored settings and re-initiate the registration process.
        *   (Optional) Input for Prusa Connect server URL if it needs to be configurable (default: `https://connect.prusa3d.com`).

Key Technical Considerations:
*   **OctoPrint API and Event Bus:** Leverage OctoPrint's internal APIs (`self._printer`, `self._file_manager`, `self._settings`) and its event bus (e.g., `Events.PRINT_STARTED`, `Events.TEMPERATURE_RECEIVED`) for reactive updates rather than constant polling where possible.
*   **Threading:** Proper threading is critical for the SDK's communication loop and for handling commands without blocking OctoPrint. The SDK itself handles some threading, but be mindful of how your plugin code interacts with it.
*   **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement comprehensive error handling for SDK communication issues, printer communication problems, and unexpected conditions. Use OctoPrint's standard logging mechanism (`self._logger`) for diagnostics. Report critical errors to Prusa Connect using `printer.event_cb(const.Event.FAILED,...)`.
*   **State Synchronization:** Ensure accurate and timely synchronization of printer state between OctoPrint's perception and what's reported to/commanded by Prusa Connect.
*   **Security of Credentials:** The Prusa Connect `TOKEN` is sensitive. Rely on OctoPrint's `SettingsPlugin` for its storage.
*   **Resource Management:** Be mindful of the Raspberry Pi's resources (CPU, memory), as both OctoPrint and the new plugin will consume them.
*   **SDK Updates:** The Prusa Connect SDK may be updated. The plugin might require maintenance to remain compatible with future SDK versions.

Illustrative Use Case:
A user with a Geeetech A10 printer running this plugin on their OctoPrint instance wants to manage it via the Prusa Connect web interface or send G-code files directly from PrusaSlicer.
1.  The user registers their OctoPrint instance (representing the Geeetech A10) with Prusa Connect through the plugin's settings.
2.  Once registered, the printer appears in their Prusa Connect dashboard.
3.  They can see real-time telemetry (temperatures, print status) from the Geeetech A10.
4.  They can upload a G-code file to Prusa Connect and initiate a print on the Geeetech A10 from the cloud.
5.  Alternatively, they can configure PrusaSlicer with the Prusa Connect details and send sliced files directly to the "cloud printer," which then relays the job to the Geeetech A10 via OctoPrint and this plugin.
6.  Commands like pause, resume, and cancel initiated from Prusa Connect are correctly executed on the Geeetech A10.

Iterative Development and Testing:
Please implement these features incrementally. Commit your progress frequently to the designated branch. This will allow me to clone the branch, install the plugin, and test the functionalities as they are developed.

The ultimate goal is to have a robust and functional OctoPrint plugin that successfully integrates the Geeetech A10 into the Prusa Connect ecosystem, mimicking the user experience of an Original Prusa printer as closely as possible within the SDK's capabilities.
