Hi Jules,

We are about to start the development of an OctoPrint plugin . The main goal is to integrate my Geeetech A10 3D printer (running Marlin 2.1 firmware, currently managed by OctoPrint on a Raspberry Pi) with Prusa Connect. To do this, we will use the official `prusa-connect-sdk-printer` Software Development Kit (SDK) provided by Prusa.

**Project Setup and Resources:**

- **Starting Repository:** You will be working on my GitHub repository https://github.com/VisualBoy/OctroPrint-PrusaConnect-Bridge,
 I will provide you with access to this repository and the specific branch where you should commit your work.
- **Reference Materials:** You will have access to:
    1. A detailed research report I received, which outlines the strategy, architecture, and technical details for this plugin https://github.com/VisualBoy/OctroPrint-PrusaConnect-Bridge/raw/refs/heads/main/.doc/Prusa%20Connect%20bridge%20for%20Octoprint%20overview.md
    2. The official documentation for OctoPrint plugin development https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/plugins/gettingstarted.html 
    3. The official documentation for the Prusa Connect SDK (`prusa-connect-sdk-printer`). Please refer to these documents for a thorough understanding of the context and technical specifications https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Connect-SDK-Printer

**Expected Output:** The primary output of your work will be functional Python code, committed iteratively to the designated branch of the GitHub repository. Each commit should represent a functional step forward, allowing me to test the plugin as development progresses.

**Detailed Development Tasks:**

I request you to implement the following functionalities in the OctoPrint plugin, committing progress regularly:

**1\. Initial Plugin Setup and Prusa Connect SDK Integration into the Repository:** \* Modify the plugin's `setup.py` file to include `prusa-connect-sdk-printer` as a dependency. \* In the `__init__.py` file (or a dedicated helper class), import and initialize the `Printer` object from the Prusa Connect SDK. Use OctoPrint's `StartupPlugin` mixin, specifically the `on_after_startup` method, for SDK initialization and starting the communication loop in a separate thread.  

**2\. Implementation of Printer Registration with Prusa Connect:** \* **Printer Identifier Management:** \* Implement logic to generate or retrieve a unique Serial Number (`SN`) for the Geeetech A10. Consider the UUID returned by Marlin's `M115` command , the Raspberry Pi's MAC address, or a randomly generated UUID. Store this `SN` persistently using OctoPrint's `SettingsPlugin`. \* Calculate the `FINGERPRINT` as a SHA256 hex digest of the `SN`. \* Use `const.PrinterType.I3MK3` as the `PRINTER_TYPE`. \* **Registration Flow:** \* If a saved token is not present, implement the `printer.register()` flow to obtain a `tmp_code` from the SDK. \* Display the `tmp_code` to the user via OctoPrint's notification system or plugin logs, with instructions to enter it on the Prusa Connect web portal. \* Implement the retrieval of the persistent `TOKEN` via `printer.get_token(tmp_code)` and store it securely using OctoPrint's `SettingsPlugin`. \* **Subsequent Starts:** Ensure the plugin uses the stored `TOKEN` to establish the connection on startup if it's already present.  

**3\. Implementation of Continuous Telemetry Transmission:** \* Create and manage a background thread that sends telemetry data to Prusa Connect via `printer.telemetry()` at least once per second. \* Implement the mapping of OctoPrint's printer states (obtained via `self._printer.get_current_data()`, e.g., "Printing", "Paused", "Operational", "Error") to the Prusa Connect SDK's `prusa.connect.printer.const.State` constants (e.g., `PRINTING`, `PAUSED`, `READY`, `ERROR`). \* Include current temperatures (from `self._printer.get_current_temperatures()`) and print progress (from `self._printer.get_current_data()`) in the telemetry.  

**4\. Implementation of Command Handling from Prusa Connect:** \* Use the SDK's `@printer.handler(const.Command.COMMAND_NAME)` decorators to implement handlers for commands sent from Prusa Connect. The priority commands are: \* `START_PRINT`: The handler must retrieve the filename from the command argument, find the file path in OctoPrint's file system (using `self._file_manager.path_on_disk("local", filename)`), and then start the print via OctoPrint (`self._printer.select_file(path_to_file, printAfterSelect=True)`). \* `STOP_PRINT`: Translate to `self._printer.cancel_print()`. \* `PAUSE_PRINT`: Translate to `self._printer.pause_print()`. \* `RESUME_PRINT`: Translate to `self._printer.resume_print()`. \* Ensure each command handler runs in a separate thread to avoid blocking the SDK's main communication loop and returns the required dictionary (at least with the `source` key).  

**5\. Implementation of File System Management for Prusa Connect:** \* Implement the logic to respond to requests for file information from Prusa Connect (typically via a `SEND_INFO` command or a similar mechanism triggered by telemetry). \* Use OctoPrint's `self._file_manager.list_files(recursive=True)` to get the list of files and folders. \* Format this information into the dictionary expected by the SDK for each file/folder, including `type`, `name`, `ro` (read-only), `m_timestamp` (last modified date), `size`, and for folders, `children`.  

**6\. Adoption of OctoPrint Plugin Best Practices:** \* Utilize OctoPrint's event bus (e.g., `Events.TEMPERATURE_RECEIVED`, `Events.PRINT_STARTED`, `Events.FILE_ADDED`) for reactive updates and to minimize direct polling of the printer where possible. \* Use OctoPrint's `SettingsPlugin` for managing all configurable and persistent settings (token, generated SN, Prusa Connect server URL, etc.). \* Implement clear and useful logging using OctoPrint's `self._logger` system to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

**Iterative Development and Testing:** I request you to implement these features incrementally. Commit your progress frequently to the designated branch. This will allow me to clone the branch, install the plugin, and test the functionalities as they are developed.

The ultimate goal is to have a robust and functional OctoPrint plugin that successfully integrates the Geeetech A10 into the Prusa Connect ecosystem.

I look forward to seeing your commits. Thanks!
