## üîß OctoPrint-PrusaConnect-Bridge

**Live G-Code Control** is an üêô **OctoPrint** plugin designed to provide fine-grained, real-time control over the G-code stream sent to your 3D printer.

### ‚ú® Features

Users can define a set of rules, each consisting of a **pattern (regular expression)** and an **action**. As each G-code command is processed, the plugin matches it against your defined patterns. If a pattern matches, the plugin can perform one of the following actions:

- üîÑ **Modify:** Alter the current G-code command (e.g., change a parameter's value).
- üö´ **Skip/Suppress:** Prevent the current G-code command from being sent.
- ‚ûï **Inject Before:** Insert custom G-code commands immediately before the matched command.
- ‚ûï **Inject After:** Insert custom G-code commands immediately after the matched command.
- üîÅ **Replace:** Substitute the current G-code command with custom G-code commands.

This enables dynamic and conditional manipulation of the G-code stream based on its content, including slicer-generated comments (e.g., `;TYPE:Bridge`, `;LAYER_CHANGE`).

### üß™ Example Use Cases

- üå¨Ô∏è **Dynamic Fan Control:** Automatically set fan speed to 100% when a line containing `;TYPE:Bridge` is detected, and revert to a lower speed when the bridge section is complete.
- üßº **Conditional G-code Injection:** Inject custom G-code commands before or after specific standard commands (e.g., add a custom nozzle wipe routine before `M600` filament change).
- üîÑ **Command Remapping/Filtering:** Change or filter out specific G-code commands on the fly.
- üß™ **Experimentation:** Test G-code variations or inject diagnostic commands without re-slicing your model.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The plugin provides a settings interface within OctoPrint where you can:
* Create, edit, and delete rules.
* Define the regex pattern for each rule. This uses standard Python regex syntax.
* Select the action type (Modify, Skip, Inject Before/After, Replace).
* Specify the G-code command(s) for actions that involve injection or replacement.
* Enable or disable individual rules.
* Control the order of rule evaluation.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It is recommended to have a basic understanding of G-code and regular expressions to use this plugin effectively. Test rules in a safe environment before relying on them for critical prints.

### üìå Important Notes

* üß© This plugin works by intercepting G-code commands via OctoPrint's `octoprint.comm.protocol.gcode.queuing` hook. This allows for robust modification of the command stream before it is sent to the printer.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è  While powerful, misconfiguration of rules could lead to unexpected printer behavior. Please use with caution and test your rules thoroughly.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è  The effectiveness of matching comments depends on your slicer generating those comments in the G-code file.
* ‚ûï  This plugin adds a new tab to the OctoPrint interface for managing rules. Screenshots provided showcase this interface.
